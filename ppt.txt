Slide 2: Introduction

    Linux and Windows are two of the most widely used operating systems.

    Each has unique strengths, making them suitable for different use cases.

    This presentation compares them based on:

        Features

        Security

        File Systems

Slide 3: Overview of Operating Systems

Linux:

    Open-source, Unix-like OS

    Developed collaboratively by the community

    Distributions: Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian, etc.

Windows:

    Proprietary OS developed by Microsoft

    Most commonly used on desktops

    Latest version: Windows 11

Slide 4: Feature Comparison ‚Äì UI & Usability

Windows:

    User-friendly GUI

    Widely supported applications

    Great for general users and gamers

Linux:

    Flexible GUI environments (GNOME, KDE, XFCE)

    More control for power users

    Steeper learning curve

Slide 5: Feature Comparison ‚Äì Performance & Customization

Windows:

    Higher system resource usage

    Less customizable at core levels

    Frequent updates can slow system

Linux:

    Lightweight, efficient on older hardware

    Highly customizable (kernel, desktop environment)

    Better suited for developers & servers

Slide 6: Security Comparison

Linux:

    Fewer viruses due to open-source nature and smaller attack surface

    User privilege model limits damage

    Frequent security updates

Windows:

    More frequent target for malware

    Strong Defender & firewall in recent versions

    Needs regular antivirus software

Slide 7: File System Comparison

Linux:

    Common file systems: ext4, Btrfs, XFS

    Case-sensitive

    Stable and efficient file handling

    Root-based directory structure

Windows:

    Common file systems: NTFS, FAT32, exFAT

    Case-insensitive

    Includes features like file compression & permissions

    Drive-letter-based structure (C:, D:)

Slide 8: Pros & Cons Summary Table
Feature	Linux	Windows
Cost	Free	Paid
Customization	High	Limited
Software Compatibility	Moderate	Excellent
Security	Strong	Improved but Targeted
User Base	Developers, Servers	General Consumers, Gamers
Slide 9: Ideal Use Cases

Linux:

    Servers, Programming, Ethical Hacking, Lightweight Desktops

Windows:

    Office Work, Gaming, Professional Software (Adobe Suite, MS Office)

Slide 10: Conclusion

    Both systems have their strengths and trade-offs.

    Choice depends on user needs:

        Power, control ‚Üí Linux

        Ease, compatibility ‚Üí Windows

    Understanding differences helps in making better tech decisions.
